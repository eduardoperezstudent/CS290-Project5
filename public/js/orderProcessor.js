/*
Add an event handler for the submit event on the form with id "orderForm" in
    the file "order.html.
This event handler must:
1. Prevent submission of the form (which is the default action for the submit
    event on a form).
2. Get the values of the 2 input elements in the form. The value of an input
    element in a form is available as the attribute "value" of the element.
3. Append a new row to the table with the id "orderTable" in the file 
    "order.html." This row must contain the values entered by the user in the 2 input elements.
